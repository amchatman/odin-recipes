                <h4>Strawberries</h4>
                <hr>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>Marinate the strawberries: in a medium bowl, combine the strawberries, sugar, lemon zest, and salt. Set aside to marinate while you make the shortcakes.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                    <li>On a large bowl, whisk together the flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the cubed butter and, using your fingers, cut in the butter until pea-sized pieces form and the mixture starts to clump together. Add 1 cup (240 ml) cream and mix just to combine</li>
                    <li>Transfer the mixture to a clean work surface and pat into a ¾-inch-thick (2 cm) rectangle. Cut into 8 squares. Use a pastry brush to brush the tops of each square with the remaining 1½ tablespoons of heavy cream and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sugar and flaky salt.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 20 minutes, until the shortcakes are cooked through and golden on top.</li>
                    <li>Cool the shortcakes, then split and serve with the marinated strawberries and whipped cream.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy</li>

                <h4>Cream Cheese Frosting</h4>
                <hr>
                <li>12 ounces brick-style cream cheese softened</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (175 grams) unsalted butter softened to room temperature</li>   
                <li> 3 cups (360 grams) powdered sugar</li>
                <li> 1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>  
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="instructions">
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray two 9-inch cake pans well with nonstick cooking spray, line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper, and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Then sift the dry ingredients to remove any lumps of cocoa powder. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed for 4-5 minutes. Add the eggs and mix until fully combined, then mix in the oil, red food color, vanilla extract, and vinegar stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
                <li>Mix in the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Make sure to mix each addition until just combined and be careful not to over mix the batter.</li>
                <li>Evenly distribute the cake batter between the two prepared cake pans and spread the batter around into one even layer. Tap the pans on the counter 2-3 times to remove any air bubbles from the cakes..</li>
                <li>Bake at 350°F (177°C) for 28-32 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Carefully remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool in the pans for 15-20 minutes. Then, carefully remove the cakes from the cake pans and place on the wire rack to cool completely. </li>
